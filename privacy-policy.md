# Privacy Policy for Simba

**Last updated: January 2025**

## Overview

Simba ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles information.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

Simba is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do NOT collect, store, transmit, or have access to any of the following:

- ❌ Your browsing history
- ❌ Personal information
- ❌ Website content or data  
- ❌ Passwords or form data
- ❌ Cookies or local storage data
- ❌ Location information
- ❌ Any other personal or sensitive data

## What Our Extension Does

Simba only:

- ✅ Reads tab URLs to identify duplicates (processed locally only)
- ✅ Accesses tab titles for display in the extension popup
- ✅ Manages tabs by closing duplicates (user-controlled functionality)

## Local Processing Only

All duplicate detection and tab management happens entirely on your local device. No data is:

- Sent to external servers
- Stored in cloud services  
- Transmitted to third parties
- Logged or recorded anywhere

## Permissions Explanation

Simba requests these Chrome permissions:

- **"tabs"** - Required to access tab information for duplicate detection
- **"host_permissions: <all_urls>"** - Required to work on all websites for automatic duplicate detection

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and nothing else.

## Data Security

Since we don't collect any data, there is no data to secure, breach, or compromise. Your browsing information never leaves your device.

## Third-Party Services

Simba does not integrate with, connect to, or use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above and posted in the Chrome Web Store listing.

## Open Source

Simba's source code is available for review, allowing you to verify our privacy claims and see exactly how the extension works.

**Summary: Simba is completely private. We can't see your data because we don't collect it. Everything happens locally on your device.**
